# ConfessTX

#### Co-authors: Miran Ahmed, Ayan Gupta, and Farhan Ahsan

## Inspiration
Loneliness and impostor syndrome are common feelings that many students face and as a consequence of this, they often struggle to express their emotions. We set out to develop ConfessTX as an outlet for students to be able to convey secrets and feelings they wouldn't otherwise have a platform to let out.

## What it does
ConfessTX is a platform that enables UT students to express their confessions or thoughts and also view/connect with others' confessions or thoughts as well.

## How we built it
Technologies used included meteor.js, javascript, html, css, material-ui

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge we faced was the learning curve. Our whole team was entirely new to almost all of the technologies implemented and it was very difficult having to learn and develop a project in a span of 18 hours.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The largest accomplishment we're proud of is being able to successfully learn and develop this project in such a short time span. We also were facing a lot of difficulty in regards to implementing the real-time functionality, but it is now almost instantaneous. When a user writes a confession from any mobile device, all other users on the web app will be updated at almost the exact timeâ€“ with no reload, or any other buffer.

## What we learned
The most significant thing learned through this experience was teamwork. This was our first hackathon and it was a very unique and rich experience in the sense that it provided us with the opportunity to work in teams in pursuit of a common goal. Through this hackathon, we learned more about such as leadership, decision-making, and collaboration.

## What's next for ConfessTX
There are many directions we can take ConfessTX in, some possible ones being a counseling-based application or even just a way to form communities of people with similar ideologies. The first priority though, is to expand to other devices such as laptop/pc and improve the UI. There was pretty much no styling as the length of the project was very focused on learning and connecting back-end functionality.
